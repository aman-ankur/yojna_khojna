# Suggested Questions Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have implemented the "Suggested Questions" feature for the Yojna Khojna chatbot as specified in the PRD. This feature displays 3-5 contextually relevant follow-up questions after each assistant response, helping users navigate government scheme information more effectively.

## Components Implemented

### Frontend Components
1. **SuggestedQuestions.tsx**: React component that displays the question chips in a horizontally scrollable container. Supports loading state and handles click events.
   
2. **useSuggestions.ts**: Custom hook that manages the fetching and state of suggested questions based on conversation context.

3. **suggestionsService.ts**: API service for communicating with the backend to fetch suggested questions.

4. **Integration with ChatMessages.tsx**: Updated to display suggested questions after each assistant message.

5. **ChatInterface.tsx**: Modified to handle sending messages from suggested question clicks.

6. **ChatContainer.tsx**: Updated to properly pass the sendMessage function to child components.

### Backend Components
1. **suggestion_service.py**: Main service for generating suggested questions with:
   - Entity extraction from conversation
   - Language detection
   - Template-based question generation
   - LLM-powered contextual question generation
   - Question prioritization and selection

2. **API Endpoint**: Added `/suggested-questions` endpoint to main.py

3. **Schemas**: Added appropriate Pydantic schemas for the API

### Testing Components
1. **Frontend Tests**:
   - Unit tests for SuggestedQuestions component
   - Tests for the useSuggestions hook
   - Tests for ChatMessages component with suggested questions

2. **Backend Tests**:
   - Unit tests for suggestion service functions
   - Integration tests for the API endpoint

## Implementation Details

### Question Generation Strategy
We implemented a hybrid approach as specified in the PRD:
1. **Entity Extraction**: Identifies scheme names, monetary amounts, and document types from conversation
2. **Template-Based Questions**: Uses predefined templates for different question categories
3. **Contextual Generation**: Uses Claude LLM to generate contextually relevant questions
4. **Language Support**: Detects conversation language and provides questions in the same language

### UI Implementation
- Horizontally scrollable chips with improved styling
- Added tooltips to display full question text on hover
- Proper text truncation for consistent appearance
- Fixed widths for chips based on screen size
- Error handling for function props
- Mobile-responsive design with proper text handling
- Language matching for questions (Hindi/English)

## Latest Improvements
1. **Fixed Clickable Functionality**:
   - Added proper function passing through component hierarchy
   - Implemented type checking and error handling for functions
   - Updated ChatContainer to correctly pass onSendMessage prop

2. **Enhanced Text Display in Chips**:
   - Implemented explicit text truncation function (limit of 30 characters)
   - Added tooltips for showing full text on hover
   - Set fixed widths for consistent appearance across devices
   - Improved styling for better visibility and interaction

3. **Limited to 4 Questions**:
   - Updated backend to return exactly 4 suggestions
   - Enhanced prompt to request exactly 4 contextually relevant questions

4. **Language Consistency**:
   - Improved language detection and matching
   - Added explicit instructions in prompt to generate questions in the same language

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock-based testing for LLM dependencies
- Error handling tests for graceful degradation

## Next Steps
1. Enhance entity extraction with more sophisticated NLP
2. Expand language translation coverage for more templates
3. Optimize performance with caching of common suggestions
4. Implement analytics tracking to measure suggestion effectiveness
5. A/B test different suggestion generation strategies
