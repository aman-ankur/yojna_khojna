# Active Context

## Current Goal
Refining Logging Setup (Task 1.9a) after verifying Configuration Management (Task 1.8) is mostly complete.

## Focus Areas
*   Centralizing logging configuration in the backend.
*   Removing `logging.basicConfig()` calls from submodules (`pdf_extractor`, `document_chunker`).
*   Ensuring consistent logging levels and formats.
*   Preparing for Task 2.1 (FastAPI API Endpoint).

## Recent Activity
*   Reviewed codebase for configuration and logging/error handling.
*   Confirmed Task 1.8 (Config Management) is largely complete using `python-dotenv`.
*   Identified Task 1.9 (Error Handling/Logging) is partially complete; error handling structure is good, but logging setup needs consolidation.
*   Completed Task 1.10: Testing (details in previous entries).

## Blockers
*   None currently.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement Task 1.9a: Refine Logging Setup:**
    *   Establish a central logging configuration (e.g., in `__init__.py` or a dedicated `logging_config.py`).
    *   Remove `basicConfig` calls from `data_pipeline/pdf_extractor.py` and `data_pipeline/document_chunker.py`.
    *   Ensure all modules use `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
2.  Begin Task 2.1: Basic API Endpoint (FastAPI).
