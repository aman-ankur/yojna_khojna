# Active Development Context

This document provides the current focus and immediate next steps for the Yojna Khojna project.

## Current Implementation Stage

We are implementing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with enhanced capabilities:

1. **Core RAG Pipeline: ✓ COMPLETED**
   - Basic document processing and retrieval
   - Conversational history management
   - API endpoints for chat interaction

2. **Enhanced Prompting: ✓ COMPLETED**
   - Implemented "Yojna Khojna Question Reformulation System" prompt for better queries
   - Created "Yojna Khojna Government Scheme Assistant" prompt for more actionable responses
   - Added response formatting to highlight monetary amounts

3. **Domain-Specific Entity Extraction: ✓ COMPLETED**
   - Implemented comprehensive domain-aware entity extraction
   - Added multilingual capability with xx_ent_wiki_sm model
   - Created extensive domain dictionary with Hindi/English term pairs
   - Developed contextual follow-up query generation
   - Added entity prioritization and robust fallback mechanism

4. **Frontend Interface: ✓ COMPLETED**
   - Implemented React-based UI with Material UI components
   - Created responsive, mobile-friendly design
   - Added bilingual support (Hindi/English)

## Current Focus

We are now focusing on:

1. **Testing & Evaluation of Enhanced Entity Extraction**
   - Completing the test suite for enhanced entity extraction
   - Implementing the remaining skipped/placeholder tests
   - Evaluating the effectiveness of domain-specific extraction
   - Verifying that results are significantly improved with diverse queries

2. **Multilingual Support Refinement**
   - Reviewing the handling of the {language} variable for responses
   - Testing with mixed Hindi/English queries
   - Ensuring proper detection and response formatting for both languages

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Testing Implementation**
   - Complete the skipped tests in backend/tests/rag/test_chain.py
   - Add integration tests for the enhanced retrieval pipeline
   - Test response formatting for various monetary amounts

2. **System Evaluation**
   - Create a diverse set of test queries across different scheme categories
   - Compare old vs. new responses for quality improvement
   - Verify cross-document connections are properly made

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Update installation instructions for the spaCy model
   - Document the entity extraction system's capabilities for team members
   - Prepare user documentation for the enhanced features

## Recent Decisions

1. **Entity Extraction Strategy:**
   - Chose to implement a domain-specific dictionary approach for better coverage
   - Switched to a multilingual spaCy model for Hindi support
   - Added bilingual term matching for comprehensive entity coverage

2. **Prompt Design:**
   - Enhanced prompts to emphasize practical, actionable information
   - Included specific guidance for formatting different answer types
   - Added cross-document connection requirements to prompts

3. **Testing Approach:**
   - Created a dedicated test script (test_entity_extraction.py) for verification
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for each component
   - Designed integration tests for the enhanced retrieval pipeline
