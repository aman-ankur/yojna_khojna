# Active Context

## Current Focus

*   **Phase:** Phase 3 Complete (Frontend Interface Development)
*   **Goal:** Prepare for Phase 4 implementation (Multilingual Support & Enhanced NLP)
*   **Recent Changes:** Completely redesigned the frontend UI using a Claude-inspired interface with gradient text effects, enhanced message styling, and bilingual support. Added new components for welcome screen, sidebar navigation, and suggested prompts.

## Key Technical Decisions Recently Made

*   **UI Design Direction:** Adopted Claude AI's aesthetic for a clean, modern chat experience with gradient text and enhanced visuals.
*   **Component Architecture:** Refactored the monolithic ChatInterface component into smaller, focused components (ChatContainer, ChatMessages, ChatInput, etc.).
*   **Language Support:** Implemented React Context API for language management with Hindi/English toggle.
*   **Styling Approach:** Used gradient backgrounds with text clipping for signature purple gradient effects.
*   **Layout Structure:** Created a two-panel layout with collapsible sidebar and main content area.
*   **Animations:** Added subtle animations for typing indicators and message transitions to enhance UX.
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensured the interface works well on both mobile and desktop with specific adaptations.

## Next Steps Considerations

*   **Testing Expansion:** Write comprehensive tests for the new UI components.
*   **Backend Multilingual Support:** Begin implementation of Phase 4 tasks for Hindi language support in the backend (OCR validation, NLP pipeline adaptation).
*   **Documentation Updates:** Ensure all UI components are well documented for future development.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Review for any performance optimizations needed in the new UI components.

## Current Goal
Develop unit tests for the new frontend components and prepare for Phase 4 implementation.

## Focus Areas
*   Finalizing knowledge base updates for Phase 2 completion.
*   Planning the merge strategy for `feature/rag-llm-integration`.
*   Starting frontend setup (React/TypeScript).

## Recent Activity

    *   Added language toggle for Hindi/English support
    *   Improved overall visual design and user experience

## Blockers
*   None currently.

## Next Steps
1.  **Write Unit Tests:** Create comprehensive tests for the new UI components.
2.  **Review Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation to reflect the current state.
3.  **Prepare for Phase 4:** Begin planning for multilingual support implementation in the backend.
