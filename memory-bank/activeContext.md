# Active Context: AI-Powered Government Scheme Assistant (Initialization)

## Current Focus

*   **Project Initiation:** Establishing the core project structure and documentation (Memory Bank).
*   **Documentation Foundation:** Capturing the initial Product Requirements (PRD) and Proof of Concept (POC) Technical Architecture ideas into the Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).
*   **Preparation for POC:** Defining the initial scope and plan for the POC development based on the outlined phases in the technical specification.

## Recent Changes

*   Created the initial set of Memory Bank core files based on user-provided PRD and Tech Spec documents.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  Create the initial `progress.md` file to reflect the starting point and planned POC phases.
2.  Create the initial `.clinerules` file (empty for now, to be populated as patterns emerge).
3.  Await further instructions to begin POC development (Phase 1: Foundation).

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The project will start with a POC focusing on core functionality (Document Processing, Basic QA, Conversational Interface, Image Understanding, Scheme Matching) as outlined in the technical specification.
*   The initial target platform is a web application (PWA).
*   Technology choices are based on the POC technical architecture document (`techContext.md`).
