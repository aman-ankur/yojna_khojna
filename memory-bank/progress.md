# Project Progress

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundational Data Pipeline & Knowledge Base

**Objective:** Build the core components to ingest PDF documents, extract text, chunk it, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector database.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   [x] **1.1: Backend Environment Setup:**
    *   Initialized Python project structure (src, tests, etc.).
    *   Set up virtual environment.
    *   Created initial `requirements.txt`.
    *   Established basic logging configuration.
*   [x] **1.2: PDF Text Extraction (pdfplumber):**
    *   Implemented `pdf_extractor.py` using `pdfplumber`.
    *   Function to extract text page by page.
*   [x] **1.3: OCR Integration (pytesseract):**
    *   Integrated `pytesseract` into `pdf_extractor.py`.
    *   Added fallback logic to use OCR if direct text extraction is insufficient.
    *   Included necessary configurations (e.g., language packs `eng+hin`).
*   [x] **1.4: Vector Database Setup (Weaviate via Docker):**
    *   Created `docker-compose.yml` for Weaviate.
    *   Ensured Weaviate container runs successfully.
    *   Added `weaviate-client` to `requirements.txt`.
*   [x] **1.5: Implement Document Chunking (using LangChain):**
    *   Created `document_chunker.py` using `langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
    *   Defined `DocumentChunk` schema in `schemas.py`.
    *   Created `main_pipeline.py` to orchestrate extraction and chunking.
    *   Tested chunking logic and pipeline integration.
*   [x] **1.6: Embedding Generation:**
    *   Choose an embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI API).
    *   Implement function in `embedding_generator.py` to generate vector embeddings for `DocumentChunk` text.
    *   Add necessary dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
*   [x] **1.7: Data Loading into Weaviate:**
    *   Implement `weaviate_loader.py` to connect to Weaviate.
    *   Define Weaviate schema for storing chunks and vectors.
    *   Load `DocumentChunk` objects and their embeddings into Weaviate.
*   [ ] **1.8: Configuration Management** - Load settings (paths, model names, DB URLs) from env vars or config file.
*   [ ] **1.9: Error Handling & Logging** - Enhance robustness and logging across the pipeline.
*   [ ] **1.10: Testing** - Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

**Current / Next Task:**

*   [ ] **1.8: Basic API Endpoint (FastAPI):**
    *   Set up a basic FastAPI application.
    *   Create an endpoint `/process-pdf` that takes a PDF file, runs the full pipeline (extract, chunk, embed, load), and returns status.
*   [ ] **1.9: Initial Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Test the end-to-end pipeline with various PDFs.
    *   Refine chunking parameters, error handling, and logging.
