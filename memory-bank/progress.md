# Progress: AI-Powered Government Scheme Assistant (Initialization)

## Current Status

*   **Project Start:** No functional components have been built yet.
*   **Foundation:** Core documentation (Memory Bank) has been initialized based on the provided PRD and POC Technical Architecture.

## What Works

*   N/A (No implementation yet)

## What's Left to Build (POC Plan)

The POC development is planned in the following phases (as per the Technical Architecture):

1.  **Phase 1: Foundation (Est. 2-3 weeks)**
    *   [ ] PDF ingestion and processing pipeline (text extraction, OCR setup)
    *   [ ] Basic vector database setup (schema, embedding storage)
    *   [ ] Simple chat interface (frontend structure)
    *   [ ] Basic LLM integration (API connection, simple prompt/response)

2.  **Phase 2: Core Functionality (Est. 3-4 weeks)**
    *   [ ] Image understanding module (feature extraction, basic classification)
    *   [ ] Scheme matching service (hybrid search logic)
    *   [ ] Enhanced conversational capabilities (RAG implementation, context handling)
    *   [ ] Integration of Image Understanding with Scheme Matching

3.  **Phase 3: Refinement (Est. 2-3 weeks)**
    *   [ ] UI/UX improvements based on initial testing
    *   [ ] Performance optimization (query speed, resource usage)
    *   [ ] User testing and feedback integration loop setup
    *   [ ] Basic deployment setup (Dockerfiles, Compose)

## Known Issues

*   N/A (No implementation yet)
