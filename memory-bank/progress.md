# Project Progress

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundational Data Pipeline & Knowledge Base

**Objective:** Build the core components to ingest PDF documents, extract text, chunk it, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector database.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   [x] **1.1: Backend Environment Setup:**
    *   Initialized Python project structure (src, tests, etc.).
    *   Set up virtual environment.
    *   Created initial `requirements.txt`.
    *   Established basic logging configuration.
*   [x] **1.2: PDF Text Extraction (pdfplumber):**
    *   Implemented `pdf_extractor.py` using `pdfplumber`.
    *   Function to extract text page by page.
*   [x] **1.3: OCR Integration (pytesseract):**
    *   Integrated `pytesseract` into `pdf_extractor.py`.
    *   Added fallback logic to use OCR if direct text extraction is insufficient.
    *   Included necessary configurations (e.g., language packs `eng+hin`).
*   [x] **1.4: Vector Database Setup (Weaviate via Docker):**
    *   Created `docker-compose.yml` for Weaviate.
    *   Ensured Weaviate container runs successfully.
    *   Added `weaviate-client` to `requirements.txt`.
*   [x] **1.5: Implement Document Chunking (using LangChain):**
    *   Created `document_chunker.py` using `langchain.text_splitter.RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
    *   Defined `DocumentChunk` schema in `schemas.py`.
    *   Created `main_pipeline.py` to orchestrate extraction and chunking.
    *   Tested chunking logic and pipeline integration.
*   [x] **1.6: Embedding Generation:**
    *   Choose an embedding model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI API).
    *   Implement function in `embedding_generator.py` to generate vector embeddings for `DocumentChunk` text.
    *   Add necessary dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
*   [x] **1.7: Data Loading into Weaviate:**
    *   Implement `weaviate_loader.py` to connect to Weaviate.
    *   Define Weaviate schema for storing chunks and vectors.
    *   Load `DocumentChunk` objects and their embeddings into Weaviate.
*   [x] **1.8: Configuration Management** - Load settings (paths, model names, DB URLs) from env vars or config file.
    *   Implemented using `python-dotenv` in `config.py`.
    *   Loads `WEAVIATE_URL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME`, `DEFAULT_TEST_PDF` with defaults.
*   [x] **1.9: Error Handling & Logging** - Enhance robustness and logging across the pipeline.
    *   Custom exceptions defined and used (`exceptions.py`).
    *   Key functions raise specific errors.
    *   Main pipeline includes `try...except` blocks for different stages.
    *   Logging centralized via `logging_config.py` and `dictConfig`. Removed `basicConfig` calls.
*   [x] **1.10: Testing** - Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests.
    *   Fixed issues with Weaviate client tests (updated to use VectorDistances instead of DistanceMetric).
    *   Enhanced embedding_generator tests with cases for mixed languages, empty text, and dimensionality checks.
    *   Added integration tests for the full pipeline from document chunks to embeddings to vector storage.
    *   Created test scaffolding for future search functionality.
    *   Added proper pytest configuration with custom markers.

**Current / Next Task:**

*   [ ] **2.1: Basic API Endpoint (FastAPI):** (Renumbered from previous 1.8)
    *   Set up a basic FastAPI application.
    *   Create an endpoint `/process-pdf` that takes a PDF file, runs the full pipeline (extract, chunk, embed, load), and returns status.
*   [ ] **2.2: Initial Testing and Refinement:** (Renumbered from previous 1.9)
    *   Test the end-to-end pipeline with various PDFs.
    *   Refine chunking parameters, error handling, and logging.
