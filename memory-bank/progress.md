# Progress: AI-Powered Government Scheme Assistant

## Current Status

*   **Phase 1 In Progress:** Foundational data pipeline setup ongoing.
*   **Backend Setup:** Python backend environment (`backend/yojna`) initialized.
*   **PDF Processing:** PDF text extraction with OCR fallback complete.
*   **Vector Database:** Weaviate instance set up and running via Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`).
*   **Dependencies:** Added `weaviate-client` to `backend/requirements.txt`.
*   **Documentation:** Core documentation (Memory Bank, .cursor, README) updated.

## What Works

*   PDF extraction script (`backend/src/data_pipeline/pdf_extractor.py`) handles text/image PDFs (Eng/Hin).
*   Local Weaviate vector database runs via `docker compose up -d`.
*   Backend project structure initiated.

## What's Left to Build (Implementation Plan Summary)

*   **Phase 1:**
    *   [X] Set up Python backend environment
    *   [X] Implement PDF ingestion and text extraction (`pdfplumber`)
    *   [X] Integrate Tesseract OCR (with Hindi support)
    *   [X] Set up vector database (Weaviate via Docker)
    *   [ ] Implement document chunking (using LangChain)
    *   [ ] Implement text embedding (Hugging Face) and storage in Weaviate
    *   [ ] Build initial pipeline script to orchestrate extraction, chunking, embedding, and storage
*   **Phase 2:** Core Conversational API (RAG - English)
*   **Phase 3:** Basic Frontend Interface
*   **Phase 4:** Multilingual Support & Enhanced NLP
*   **Phase 5:** Scheme Matching & Personalization
*   **Phase 6:** Image Understanding, Application Guidance & Deployment Prep
*   **Phase 7:** Testing, Deployment & Iteration

## Known Issues/Next Steps

*   Next technical step: Implement document chunking (Task 1.5).
*   Need to implement text embedding and storage in Weaviate (Task 1.6).
*   Need to build the overall data pipeline orchestration script (Task 1.7).
*   OCR accuracy might need further tuning based on diverse documents.
