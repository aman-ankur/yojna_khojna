# Progress: AI-Powered Government Scheme Assistant

## Current Status

*   **Phase 1 In Progress:** Foundational data pipeline work has started.
*   **Backend Setup:** Python backend environment (`backend/yojna`) initialized with core dependencies.
*   **PDF Processing:** Initial implementation for PDF text extraction with OCR fallback (using `pdfplumber` and `pytesseract`) is complete.
*   **Foundation:** Core documentation (Memory Bank) updated with implementation plan and project rules.

## What Works

*   Python script (`backend/src/data_pipeline/pdf_extractor.py`) can extract text from both text-based and image-based PDFs (English & Hindi) using direct extraction and Tesseract OCR fallback.
*   Basic backend project structure is in place.

## What's Left to Build (Implementation Plan Summary)

*   **Phase 1:**
    *   [X] Set up Python backend environment
    *   [X] Implement PDF ingestion and text extraction (`pdfplumber`)
    *   [X] Integrate Tesseract OCR (with Hindi support)
    *   [ ] Set up vector database (Weaviate/Pinecone)
    *   [ ] Implement document chunking
    *   [ ] Implement text embedding (Hugging Face) and storage
    *   [ ] Build initial pipeline scripts
*   **Phase 2:** Core Conversational API (RAG - English)
*   **Phase 3:** Basic Frontend Interface
*   **Phase 4:** Multilingual Support & Enhanced NLP
*   **Phase 5:** Scheme Matching & Personalization
*   **Phase 6:** Image Understanding, Application Guidance & Deployment Prep
*   **Phase 7:** Testing, Deployment & Iteration

## Known Issues/Next Steps

*   Need to set up the vector database (Task 1.4).
*   Need to implement document chunking and embedding (Tasks 1.5, 1.6).
*   OCR accuracy might need tuning depending on document quality.
