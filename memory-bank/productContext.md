# Product Context: AI-Powered Government Scheme Assistant

## Problem Statement

Accessing and understanding government welfare schemes in India is often challenging for citizens due to:
*   Complex language and jargon used in official documents.
*   Information scattered across multiple sources.
*   Difficulty in determining eligibility based on individual circumstances.
*   Lack of awareness about available schemes.
*   Language barriers (need for both Hindi and English support).

This information gap prevents many eligible citizens from benefiting from crucial government support.

## Target Users

*   Citizens across India, particularly those in rural and semi-urban areas.
*   Varied education levels from limited literacy to secondary education.
*   Limited familiarity with bureaucratic processes and government terminology.
*   Multiple economic backgrounds with focus on economically disadvantaged.
*   Primarily regional language users with varying comfort in official terminology.
*   Various life situations including:
    - Disaster victims seeking relief
    - Farmers looking for agricultural support programs
    - Job seekers needing employment scheme information
    - Students seeking educational scholarships
    - Women looking for gender-specific welfare schemes
    - Elderly individuals seeking pension benefits
    - Differently-abled persons needing disability assistance
    - Healthcare seekers requiring medical support programs

## User Needs:

*   Information on eligibility for various welfare schemes
*   Application process guidance for benefits and subsidies
*   Clarification on entitlements across multiple domains
*   Document requirements for different government programs
*   Verification of benefits they've heard about through word-of-mouth
*   Assistance navigating complex government systems

## How It Should Work (User Experience Goals)

*   **Conversational & Intuitive:** Users should be able to interact naturally with the assistant in Hindi or English, asking questions as they would to a human expert.
*   **Personalized Guidance:** The assistant should tailor information and recommendations based on the user's provided profile details (location, income, category, needs).
*   **Clear Eligibility Assessment:** Users should receive a straightforward assessment of their eligibility for schemes, with clear explanations for inclusion and exclusion criteria.
*   **Step-by-Step Application Support:** The assistant should guide users through application processes, outlining required documents and procedures.
*   **Trustworthy & Transparent:** Information provided must be accurate, sourced from official documents, and include citations where possible. The system should clearly state when it cannot find specific information.
*   **Accessible:** The interface (initially web-based) should be simple, responsive, and optimized for low-bandwidth conditions.

## Key User Journeys (Examples)

1.  **Scheme Discovery:** A user expresses a need (e.g., "I need help building a house") and the assistant asks clarifying questions to identify relevant schemes like Abua Awaas Yojana, explaining the benefits.
2.  **Eligibility Check:** A user asks if they qualify for a specific scheme. The assistant guides them through a series of questions based on official criteria and provides a clear yes/no answer with justification.
3.  **Application Process:** A user asks how to apply for a scheme they are eligible for. The assistant provides step-by-step instructions, lists required documents, and gives contact information for relevant authorities.
4.  **Specific Question:** A user asks a detailed question about a scheme (e.g., "What is the exact subsidy amount for farmers under scheme X?"). The assistant retrieves the specific answer from its knowledge base, citing the source document.
